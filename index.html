  <h1>A technology leader who stays close to the work</h1>
  <p>
    I have spent my career solving complex technology and operational problems in
    enterprise environments — from modernizing legacy infrastructure to stabilizing
    large, multi-region IT operations and reducing risk at scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    A defining principle of my work is staying deeply connected to technology while
    operating at leadership and advisory levels. I believe strong technology outcomes
    come from sound architecture, disciplined execution, and leaders who understand
    the systems they are accountable for.

  <h2>About / My Story</h2>
  <p>
    I began my career in hands-on technical roles, working directly on live production
    environments where reliability, security, and uptime mattered every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later, I deliberately returned to an individual contributor role as a Chief
    Architect to stay grounded in technology, architecture trade-offs, and real-world
    problem solving.
