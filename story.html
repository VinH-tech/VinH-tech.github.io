    <h2>From Engineering Foundations to Enterprise Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      I began my career in hands-on engineering and delivery roles, developing a deep
      understanding of enterprise infrastructure, networks, and platforms.
      Over time, my scope expanded into leading large teams, managing complex programs,
      and shaping enterprise-wide transformation initiatives.

    <h2>Operating at Scale</h2>
    <p>
      Across roles, I have led global organizations of hundreds of professionals,
      overseen multi-million-dollar technology estates, and partnered closely with
      senior business and technology leaders to align execution with strategy.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I believe effective technology leadership combines architectural rigor,
      operational discipline, and clear communication. My approach emphasizes
      simplicity, accountability, and sustained value creation.
